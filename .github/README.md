# Penetration Testing Tools

This repo is home to scripts, tools, programs, and other materials that I find useful for penetration testing.

I am not responsible for your stupidity while using these tools.  Obey any relevant laws/rules and don't use this stuff for evil.

# Organization

Folder names should be logical.  Networking stuff goes in the `Networking` folder, and so forth.

There is no table of contents.  Maybe in the future, but for now, search bar is `ls -lahR | grep "search query"`.
